# Linux udev support file.
#
# This is a example udev file for HIDAPI devices which changes the permissions
# to 0666 (world readable/writable) for a specific device on Linux systems.
#
# - Copy this file into /etc/udev/rules.d and unplug and re-plug your Coldcard.
# - Udev does not have to be restarted.
#

# probably not needed:
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="d13e", ATTRS{idProduct}=="cc10", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0666"

# required:
# from <https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/blob/master/udev/99-hid.rules>
